# SENTRY-LOGIC – Symbolic Observer Layer for LLMs

**A novel symbolic audit & observer framework**  
**Author**: Tom Wartenberg  
**Contact**: tomirn@mailbox.org  
**Full Technical Release**: https://zenodo.org/records/15380508

## Overview

SENTRY-LOGIC introduces a symbolic observer and audit layer that runs alongside modern LLM systems. It enables behavioral transparency, transition logging, and structured alerting by embedding symbolic hooks into the I/O decision pathway.

This framework is especially relevant for:

- AI safety & LLM monitoring
- Symbolic oversight systems
- Government-level AI deployments
- Red/Blue Team audits
- Defense-oriented LLM scenarios

## Features

- Proxy-based & middleware integration paths  
- Symbolic log system (SLS) with logical tracepoints  
- Dynamic alert subsystem for anomaly detection  
- REDTEAM-ready deployment modules  
- Optional extensions for military-grade usage
